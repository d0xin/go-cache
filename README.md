# go-cache

go-cache is a caching system for Golang with background stale cache regeneration.

go-cache is separated into a `cacher` (a struct that provides an interface for getting and expiring keys), `engines` (a
number of different storage types, including in memory, Redis, and Aerospike), and `joque` (a job queue using go
routines and channel communication).

As go-cache is a stale cache, once an item has expired, it is not removed from the cache automatically. Instead, it will
continue to return the value currently stored, and recreate the value concurrently. Once processed, it will replace the
existing value, which will be returned by subsequent cache get requests.

An additional time value, cleanupTTL, is passed to the cacher, which is used to remove keys which have expired but not
regenerated by the given time. This stops the cache from becoming full of very old values that may not be used or, when
they are requested, return very stale data.
